# p4k-webscraper
Python built tool which 'scrapes' a webpage. In this case the webpage is the top 50 albums of 2019 on Pitchfork.

The python script uses beautiful soup to scrape the site URL https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/best-albums-2019/ and outputs the artists, albums and rank into a .csv file.
